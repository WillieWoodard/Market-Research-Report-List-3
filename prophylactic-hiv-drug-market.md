<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Prophylactic HIV Drug Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Nucleoside or Nucleotide Reverse Transcriptase Inhibitors (NRTI)</li><li>Integrase Inhibitor</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The Prophylactic HIV Drug Market encompasses different types of medications used to prevent the transmission of HIV. Nucleoside or Nucleotide Reverse Transcriptase Inhibitors (NRTIs) are a class of drugs that work by blocking an enzyme called reverse transcriptase, which is necessary for the HIV virus to replicate. Integrase Inhibitors, on the other hand, prevent the integration of the viral DNA into the host cell's DNA, inhibiting the virus's ability to reproduce. Both NRTIs and Integrase Inhibitors play a crucial role in HIV prevention by effectively targeting different stages of the virus's life cycle.</p></p>
