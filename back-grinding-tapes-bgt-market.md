<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Back Grinding Tapes (BGT) Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>UV Type</li><li>Non-UV Type</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Back Grinding Tapes (BGT) are used in the semiconductor manufacturing process to protect wafers during the back grinding process. There are two main types of BGT: UV Type and Non-UV Type. UV Type BGT utilizes ultraviolet light to cure the tape, providing a strong adhesion to the wafer. Non-UV Type BGT does not require UV light for curing and relies on other methods for adhesion. Both types cater to different market needs and preferences in the semiconductor industry.</p></p>
