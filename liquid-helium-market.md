<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Liquid Helium Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>He I</li><li>He II</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Liquid helium is divided into two types based on its temperature and properties: He I and He II. He I refers to helium at temperatures above 2.18 K, where it behaves as a normal fluid with high thermal conductivity. On the other hand, He II refers to helium below 2.18 K, known as superfluid helium. In this state, helium exhibits unique properties such as zero viscosity, high heat conductivity, and the ability to climb walls. The market for liquid helium is segmented based on the applications of each type in various industries.</p></p>
