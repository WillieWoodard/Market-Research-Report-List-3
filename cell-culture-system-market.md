<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Cell Culture System Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>2D Cell Culture System</li><li>3D Cell Culture System</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The cell culture system market includes two types: 2D cell culture system and 3D cell culture system. In a 2D cell culture system, cells are grown in a single, flat layer in a culture dish. This system is widely used and relatively simple, but it may not fully represent the complex environment of cells in living organisms. In a 3D cell culture system, cells are grown in a more realistic three-dimensional structure, which better mimics the natural cellular environment. This system enables improved cell-to-cell interactions and provides a closer representation of in vivo conditions.</p></p>
