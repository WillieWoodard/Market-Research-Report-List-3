<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Automotive Radiator Reservoir Tank Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Pressurized</li><li>Non-pressurized</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Automotive radiator reservoir tanks are available in two main types - pressurized and non-pressurized. Pressurized reservoir tanks are designed to withstand high pressure levels generated inside the cooling system, allowing for efficient heat exchange. Non-pressurized reservoir tanks, on the other hand, are not built to withstand high pressures and are often used in older vehicles or in situations where pressurization is not necessary. Both types play a crucial role in maintaining proper coolant levels and preventing overheating in automotive engines.</p></p>
