<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Cyclooxygenase 2 Inhibitor Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Selective Cox 2 Inhibitor</li><li>Non-Selective Cox 2 Inhibitor</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Cyclooxygenase 2 (Cox-2) inhibitor market types include selective and non-selective inhibitors. Selective Cox-2 inhibitors specifically target and block the Cox-2 enzyme responsible for inflammation, while sparing Cox-1 enzyme that protects the stomach lining. These inhibitors are commonly used to treat pain and inflammation while minimizing gastrointestinal side effects. On the other hand, non-selective Cox-2 inhibitors block both Cox-1 and Cox-2 enzymes, which can lead to higher risks of gastrointestinal complications. Understanding and utilizing the appropriate type of Cox-2 inhibitor is crucial for effectively managing pain and inflammation with minimal side effects.</p></p>
