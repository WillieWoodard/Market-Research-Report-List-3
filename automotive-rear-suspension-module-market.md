<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Automotive Rear Suspension Module Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Independent Suspension Module</li><li>Semi-Dependent Suspension Module</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The automotive rear suspension module market consists of two main types: independent suspension modules and semi-dependent suspension modules. Independent suspension modules allow each wheel to move independently, providing better handling and a smoother ride. Semi-dependent suspension modules connect both wheels on an axle, sharing some components but still allowing for more independent movement compared to solid rear axles. Both types offer different advantages depending on the vehicle's intended use and desired performance characteristics.</p></p>
