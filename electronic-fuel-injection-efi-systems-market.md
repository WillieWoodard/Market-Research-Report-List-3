<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Electronic Fuel Injection (EFI) Systems Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Single-point Injection Systems</li><li>Multi-point Injection Systems</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Electronic Fuel Injection (EFI) Systems market consists of two main types; Single-point Injection Systems and Multi-point Injection Systems. Single-point Injection Systems use a single injector to deliver fuel to all cylinders, which is more cost-effective but less efficient compared to Multi-point Injection Systems. Multi-point Injection Systems have individual injectors for each cylinder, providing better fuel distribution and improved performance. The market for Multi-point Injection Systems is growing due to its superior efficiency and performance compared to Single-point Injection Systems.</p></p>
