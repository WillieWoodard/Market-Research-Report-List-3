<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Calcium Heparin Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Low Molecular Weight Heparin Calcium Injection</li><li>Nadroparin Calcium Injection</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The Calcium Heparin market includes two main types: Low Molecular Weight Heparin Calcium Injection and Nadroparin Calcium Injection. Low Molecular Weight Heparin Calcium Injection is a form of Calcium Heparin that has a smaller molecular weight, allowing for easier absorption and longer duration of action. It is often used to prevent blood clotting during surgeries or in the treatment of deep vein thrombosis. On the other hand, Nadroparin Calcium Injection is a specific formulation of Calcium Heparin used to prevent blood clots in patients who are at high risk, such as those undergoing surgery or bedridden individuals. Both types of Calcium Heparin provide anticoagulant effects but differ in their molecular weight and specific application.</p></p>
