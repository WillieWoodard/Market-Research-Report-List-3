<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Medium-Density Fibreboard Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Monolayer</li><li>Multi-storey</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Medium-density fiberboard (MDF) market is segmented into monolayer and multi-storey types. Monolayer MDF refers to the production process where single layers of wood fibers are compressed together to form a sheet of MDF. On the other hand, multi-storey MDF involves the stacking of multiple layers of fibers to create a thicker and denser board. While monolayer MDF is commonly used for furniture and cabinetry, multi-storey MDF finds applications in construction and flooring due to its higher density and strength.</p></p>
