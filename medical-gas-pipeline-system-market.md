<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Medical Gas Pipeline System Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Centralized Type</li><li>Distributed Type</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Medical gas pipeline systems can be classified into two main types: Centralized Type and Distributed Type. The Centralized Type system involves a central source of gas supply that distributes gases to various points of care throughout a healthcare facility through a network of pipelines. On the other hand, the Distributed Type system consists of individual gas cylinders or tanks located in close proximity to point of use, providing a more localized source of gas supply. Both types have their own benefits and considerations based on the specific needs of healthcare facilities.</p></p>
