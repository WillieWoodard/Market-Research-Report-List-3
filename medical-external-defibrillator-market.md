<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Medical External Defibrillator Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Semi-Automatic Defibrillator</li><li>Automatic Defibrillator</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The medical external defibrillator market encompasses two types: semi-automatic defibrillators and automatic defibrillators. Semi-automatic defibrillators require the user to manually initiate the shock delivery, while automatic defibrillators automatically analyze the heart rhythm and deliver shocks without the need for user intervention. Both types are essential in treating cardiac arrests by delivering electrical shocks to restore normal heart rhythm. However, semi-automatic defibrillators provide users with more control and require their active involvement, while automatic defibrillators offer a more automated and user-friendly approach.</p></p>
