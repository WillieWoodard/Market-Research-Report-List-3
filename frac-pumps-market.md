<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Frac Pumps Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Triplex Frac Pumps</li><li>Quintuplex Frac Pumps</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Frac pumps are used in the hydraulic fracturing process to pump high-pressure fluid into oil and gas wells to create fractures in the rock formation. The two main types of frac pumps are triplex and quintuplex. Triplex frac pumps have three plungers while quintuplex frac pumps have five plungers, allowing them to achieve higher flow rates and pressures. Both types of pumps are commonly used in the oil and gas industry for well stimulation and production.</p></p>
