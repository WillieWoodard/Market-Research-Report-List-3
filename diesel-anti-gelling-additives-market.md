<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Diesel Anti-gelling Additives Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Concentrated Diesel Anti-gelling Additives</li><li>Ready-to-use Diesel Anti-gelling Additives</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Concentrated Diesel Anti-gelling Additives are highly potent formulas that require dilution before use. They are cost-effective for large volume applications and provide a high level of protection against gelling in cold temperatures. Ready-to-use Diesel Anti-gelling Additives, on the other hand, come pre-mixed and are easy to use without any dilution required. They are convenient for smaller scale applications but may be more expensive per unit compared to concentrated additives. Both types of additives help prevent diesel fuel from gelling in cold weather conditions.</p></p>
