<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Submarine Power Cable Systems Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Single Core Cable</li><li>Multicore Cable</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Submarine power cable systems market includes two types of cables: single core cable and multicore cable. Single core cable refers to a power cable with a single conductor that carries electric current. It is commonly used for high voltage applications, as it provides better insulation and reduces the risk of electrical interference. On the other hand, multicore cable consists of multiple conductors within a single cable, allowing for the transmission of multiple signals or power sources simultaneously. This type of cable is often used in applications where space and cost efficiency are important factors.</p></p>
