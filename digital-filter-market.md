<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Digital Filter Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Infinite Impulse Response (IIR)</li><li>Finite Impulse Response (FIR)</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Digital filters are used to process and modify digital signals. The market for digital filters can be categorized into two main types: Infinite Impulse Response (IIR) and Finite Impulse Response (FIR) filters. IIR filters are characterized by feedback loops in their design, allowing for more efficient processing of signals with fewer parameters. FIR filters, on the other hand, do not use feedback loops and have a finite number of parameters, making them easier to implement and design. Both types of filters have their own advantages and are used in various applications.</p></p>
