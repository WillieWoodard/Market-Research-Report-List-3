<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Alzheimer's Drugs Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Acetylcholinesterase (AChE) Inhibitors</li><li>Glutamate Inhibitors</li><li>Other</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The Alzheimer's drugs market comprises three main types of medications: Acetylcholinesterase (AChE) inhibitors, Glutamate inhibitors, and other drugs. AChE inhibitors work by enhancing the levels of acetylcholine, a chemical involved in memory and learning, in the brain. By inhibiting the enzyme that breaks down acetylcholine, these drugs help improve communication between brain cells. Glutamate inhibitors, on the other hand, regulate the levels of glutamate, a neurotransmitter that can be excessively produced in Alzheimer's patients, leading to cell damage. Lastly, other drugs include a variety of medications targeting different aspects of the disease, such as inflammation or oxidative stress.</p></p>
