<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Exhaust Catalyst Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Tightly Coupled Catalyst</li><li>Bottom Tray Catalyst</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Tightly Coupled Catalysts are located closer to the engine, allowing for quicker activation to reduce emissions during cold start-up. Bottom Tray Catalysts are positioned further downstream in the exhaust system, providing additional treatment for emissions before they are released into the environment. Tightly Coupled Catalysts are more efficient at reducing emissions during start-up, while Bottom Tray Catalysts offer further emission reduction benefits at higher operating temperatures. Both types of catalysts play a crucial role in reducing harmful pollutants from vehicle emissions.</p></p>
