<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Absorbent Foam Wound Dressing Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Without Adhesive Border</li><li>With Adhesive Border</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Absorbent foam wound dressings are available in two types: without adhesive border and with adhesive border. Without adhesive border dressings do not have any adhesive on the edges, making them suitable for wounds located in areas where adhesive may cause discomfort or irritation. With adhesive border dressings, on the other hand, feature a sticky border that helps secure the dressing in place. This type is commonly used for wounds in areas with high movement or friction, as it provides better adherence and prevents dressing displacement. Both types offer effective absorbency and promote wound healing.</p></p>
