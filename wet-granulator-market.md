<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Wet Granulator Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>High-shear</li><li>Low-shear</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Wet granulators are used in the pharmaceutical and other industries for the process of granulation. There are two main types of wet granulator markets based on the shear force used during the process: high-shear and low-shear. High-shear granulators use intense mechanical force to break down materials, resulting in smaller and more uniform granules. On the other hand, low-shear granulators use gentler force, which is suitable for heat-sensitive materials. Both types of granulators have their own advantages and are used based on specific requirements of the industry.</p></p>
