<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Natural Gas Filling Stations Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>CNG Filling Stations</li><li>LNG Filling Stations</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Natural gas filling stations refer to specialized facilities where vehicles can refuel with natural gas. There are two main types of natural gas filling stations: CNG (Compressed Natural Gas) filling stations and LNG (Liquefied Natural Gas) filling stations. CNG stations compress natural gas to high pressures, allowing it to be stored in cylinders onboard vehicles. LNG stations, on the other hand, cool natural gas to a liquid state, reducing its volume for transportation and storage. Both types of filling stations offer an alternative to traditional gasoline or diesel fuel, providing cleaner and more sustainable options for transportation.</p></p>
