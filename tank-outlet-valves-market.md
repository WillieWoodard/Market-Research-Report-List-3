<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Tank Outlet Valves Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Single Seat</li><li>Double Seat</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Tank outlet valves come in two main types: single seat and double seat. Single seat valves have only one sealing point, making them simpler and more cost-effective. However, they may not provide as tight a seal as double seat valves, which have two sealing points for added reliability. Double seat valves are often used in applications where leakage prevention is critical. Both types have their own advantages and are chosen based on factors like cost, application requirements, and desired level of sealing efficiency.</p></p>
