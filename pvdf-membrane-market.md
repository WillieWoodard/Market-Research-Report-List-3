<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The PVDF Membrane Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Hydrophobic</li><li>Hydrophilic</li></ul></p>
<p><p>PVDF membranes are available in two main types: hydrophobic and hydrophilic. Hydrophobic membranes repel water while allowing the passage of non-aqueous solutions, making them ideal for applications requiring low protein binding. Conversely, hydrophilic membranes attract water and are effective for filtration of aqueous solutions. The choice between these two types depends on the specific needs of the application, with hydrophobic membranes being more suitable for oil-based solutions and hydrophilic membranes for water-based solutions.</p></p>
