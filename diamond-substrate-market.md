<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Diamond Substrate Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>ChemicalVaporDeposition(CVD)Substrate</li><li>HPHTDiamondSubstrate</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Diamond substrate market can be categorized into two main types: Chemical Vapor Deposition (CVD) substrate and High Pressure High Temperature (HPHT) diamond substrate. CVD substrate is produced through a chemical process where carbon vapor is deposited onto a substrate material, creating a thin diamond film. HPHT diamond substrate, on the other hand, is created by subjecting a carbon source to extreme heat and pressure, forming natural diamond crystals. Both types of diamond substrates have various applications in industries such as electronics, optics, and thermal management.</p></p>
