<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Geothermal Electric Power Generation Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Dry Steam Stations</li><li>Flash Steam Power Stations</li><li>Binary Cycle Stations</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Geothermal electric power generation consists of three main types of stations - Dry Steam Stations, Flash Steam Power Stations, and Binary Cycle Stations. Dry Steam Stations utilize steam directly from underground reservoirs to drive turbines and generate electricity. Flash Steam Power Stations use high-pressure hot water from the reservoir, which is flashed into steam to power turbines. Binary Cycle Stations transfer heat from the geothermal water to a secondary fluid with a lower boiling point, which then drives turbines. Each type of station harnesses the Earth's natural heat to produce sustainable electricity.</p></p>
