<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Hydrostatic Bearing Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Radial Bearing</li><li>Thrust Bearing</li><li>Radial Thrust Bearing</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Hydrostatic bearing market types include radial bearings, thrust bearings, and radial thrust bearings. Radial bearings support loads perpendicular to the shaft axis, allowing it to rotate smoothly. They are commonly used in applications where the load is primarily radial. Thrust bearings, on the other hand, support loads parallel to the axis, enabling axial movement. These bearings are used when there is a need to accommodate thrust loads, such as in turbines or gearboxes. Radial thrust bearings combine the functionalities of both radial and thrust bearings, supporting both radial and axial loads simultaneously, making them suitable for various applications.</p></p>
