<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Tungsten CMP Slurry Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Selective Tungsten Slurries</li><li>Non-Selective Tungsten Slurries</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Tungsten CMP slurry is classified into two main types: selective and non-selective tungsten slurries. Selective tungsten slurries are specifically designed to target and remove tungsten material during the chemical mechanical polishing process, providing precise control and higher material removal rates. On the other hand, non-selective tungsten slurries are more general-purpose and can be used for a wider range of applications, but may not offer the same level of precision or efficiency in removing tungsten material.</p></p>
