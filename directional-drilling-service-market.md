<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Directional Drilling Service Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Conventional System</li><li>Rotary Steerable System</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Directional drilling services can be categorized into two main types â€“ the conventional system and the rotary steerable system. In the conventional system, a downhole mud motor is used to bend the drill bit in the desired direction. On the other hand, the rotary steerable system utilizes downhole tools that steer the drill bit using rotational movements. The rotary steerable system is known for its higher efficiency and accuracy compared to the conventional system, making it a popular choice in the directional drilling service market.</p></p>
