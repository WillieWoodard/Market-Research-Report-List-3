<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Portable Carbon Dioxide Monitor Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Mainstream Carbon Dioxide Monitor</li><li>Sidestream Carbon Dioxide Monitor</li><li>Others</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The portable carbon dioxide monitor market is categorized into three types: mainstream carbon dioxide monitor, sidestream carbon dioxide monitor, and others. Mainstream carbon dioxide monitors are directly connected to the airway and measure the carbon dioxide levels in the exhaled breath. Sidestream carbon dioxide monitors, on the other hand, aspirate a small sample of the patient's exhaled air to measure the carbon dioxide levels. The "others" category includes alternative techniques and devices for monitoring carbon dioxide levels, which may not fall under the mainstream or sidestream methods.</p></p>
