<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The 3D Cell Culture Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Scaffold-based</li><li>Scaffold-free</li><li>Microchips</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The 3D cell culture market is divided into three types based on the structure used to cultivate cells. Scaffold-based 3D cell culture involves using a framework or scaffold to support cell growth and mimic the natural cellular environment. Scaffold-free 3D cell culture methods do not require a scaffold, instead relying on cell-cell interactions to form aggregates and spheroids. Microchips in 3D cell culture involve utilizing microfabricated structures to create a controlled environment for the cells, enabling high-throughput screening and real-time monitoring of cellular behavior. These different types offer diverse approaches for studying cells in a three-dimensional context.</p></p>
