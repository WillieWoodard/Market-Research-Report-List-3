<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Skin Resurfacing Machine Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Ablative</li><li>Non-ablative</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Skin resurfacing machines are categorized into two main types: ablative and non-ablative. Ablative treatments involve removing layers of skin to stimulate collagen production and regeneration, resulting in significant improvements in skin texture and tone. Non-ablative treatments, on the other hand, work by delivering energy to deeper layers of skin without damaging the outer layer, making them less invasive and requiring less downtime. Both types of treatments are popular choices for individuals looking to reduce the appearance of wrinkles, scars, and other skin imperfections.</p></p>
