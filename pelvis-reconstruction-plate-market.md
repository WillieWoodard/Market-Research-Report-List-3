<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Pelvis Reconstruction Plate Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Locking</li><li>Non-Locking</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The pelvis reconstruction plate market consists of two main types: locking and non-locking plates. Locking plates have special screw holes that can lock the screws in place, providing more stability and preventing dislodgement. These plates are suitable for severe pelvic fractures or cases where there is poor bone quality. Non-locking plates, on the other hand, do not have this locking feature and rely on normal compression forces to hold the fracture together. They are typically used for stable pelvic fractures or cases with good bone quality.</p></p>
